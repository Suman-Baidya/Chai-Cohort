# JS Object & Prototype

### Object
- Objects has properties like color, weight and Methods like actions, functions
- Method: When a function used in object, then it called Method.

### Class
- To create same type object with different values we use "Class"
- Class is a blue print or parent 
- it's child take "new" keyword to creating object

### __proto__
- it is a prototype of object
- Prototype Chaining: when "  __proto__ = null  " then it stop
- that's why in JS everything is an Object. Last __proto__ value is object and it's __proto__ is null.
- Blueprint => Prototype
- Object => __proto__  prototype of Blueprint
