### All about Object
- a variable is a memory
- all variable use STACK to exicute
- variable in STACK --> exicute --> out of scope --> garbage collector --> out of STACK
- Spread Operator ... use to exact value copying from one object to other object.
- (...) is use to Shallow Copying, mens Nested object not exact copying to others.
- Nested Array or Nested object is referance copying by (...)
- to Doing Deep Copy= first convert Object to String, then copy to other variable/memory, then convert string to Object

- object1 = object2 (Pass by Refferance)
- object2 = { ...object1 } (Pass by Value) --> Shallow Copy
- const convert JSON.stringify(object1); <br>
   object2 = JSON.parse(convert) --> Deep Copy
- (Non Primitive --> Primitive --> Non Primitive)
